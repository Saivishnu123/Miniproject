Autonomous vehicles have been considered as one of the most important trending topics in the domain of intelligent transportation systems. It is expected that most of the leading companies will launch their fully self-driving vehicles by the end of the next decade. Such a technology must assure a high safety level on road networks to reduce the number of accidents caused by human errors. All the built-in technologies must be integrated and complemented to achieve these goals. Automated object and obstacle detection is one of the main research tasks that must be taken.
